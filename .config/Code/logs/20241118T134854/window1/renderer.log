2024-11-18 13:48:56.791 [error] Extension 'ms-vscode.cpptools' wants API proposal 'lmTools' but that proposal DOES NOT EXIST. Likely, the proposal has been finalized (check 'vscode.d.ts') or was abandoned.

2024-11-18 13:49:03.763 [error] [Extension Host] [chat] Registration of interactive providers failed: Error: Extension 'GitHub.copilot-chat' CANNOT use API proposal: aiTextSearchProvider.
Its package.json#enabledApiProposals-property declares: interactive, terminalDataWriteEvent, terminalExecuteCommandEvent, terminalSelection, terminalQuickFixProvider, chatParticipant, chatParticipantAdditions, defaultChatParticipant, chatVariableResolver, chatProvider, mappedEditsProvider, aiRelatedInformation, codeActionAI, findTextInFiles, textSearchProvider, contribSourceControlInputBoxMenu, newSymbolNamesProvider, findFiles2, extensionsAny, authLearnMore, testObserver but NOT aiTextSearchProvider.
 The missing proposal MUST be added and you must start in extension development mode or use the following command line switch: --enable-proposed-api GitHub.copilot-chat
